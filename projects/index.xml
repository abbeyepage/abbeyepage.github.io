​
Non-maternal carers (allomothers) are hypothesized to lighten the mother’s workload, allowing for the specialized human life history including relatively short interbirth intervals and multiple dependent offspring. To date, evolutionary anthropology’s approach to understanding allomothering has largely (but not exclusively) investigated the ultimate explanations of allomothering (i.</description>

BACKGROUND
Since the early 1990’s, breastfeeding has been on the global public health agenda, yet breastfeeding rates remain low. The UK performs particularly poorly; while 73% of women initiate, only 47.3% are still breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks. Despite this, many women report a desire to breastfeed for longer.</description>

​
BACKGROUND
There has long been academic interest in the relationship between fertility and mode of subsistence, spanning anthropology, demography and archaeology. From a prehistoric perspective, archaeologists have pointed to significant population expansions, often referred to as the Neolithic Demographic Transition, due to significant increases in fertility associated, and arguably caused by, the onset of agriculture 12,000-6,000 BP (Diamond, 2002; Diamond and Bellwood, 2003; Bocquet-Appel, 2008; Guerrero, Naji and Bocquet‐Appel, 2008).</description>

While the public health literature demonstrates a positive association between social support and breastfeeding, research has generally focused on informational and emotional support, overlooking practical help. Research also overlook wider sources of support, such as grandparents. Informed by evolutionary theory, we investigate how different types of support from different allomothers are associated with breastfeeding duration and maternal experience of infant feeding.</description>

PhD in Biologcal Anthropology at UCL

​
My PhD was part of the Hunter-gatherers Resilience Project at UCL which studied hunter-gatherers in Congo (Mbendjele), Malaysia(Batek), Thailand (Maniq) and the Philippines (Agta), using behavioural ecology, life history theory, theories of cooperation, cultural transmission and genetics to explore how variation in life history traits, kin selection, mate systems, cooperative behaviour, differentially contribute to hunter-gatherer resilience in the past, present and future.</description>
