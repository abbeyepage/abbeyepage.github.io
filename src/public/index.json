B 376: 20200026.\nAbstract\nNon-maternal caregivers (allomothers) are hypothesised to lighten the mother’s workload, producing human’s specialised life history where multiple dependent offspring are produced over a relatively short time period. Here, using in-depth observational data on who for cares for 78 Agta children (aged 0-6 years, a foraging population in northern Philippines), we explore whether allomaternal childcare substitutes (and thus decreases) maternal childcare. Previous work has investigated the role of fathers, grandmothers and siblings as allomothers, frequently overlooking non-relatives, particularly juveniles providing ‘collective childcare’in playgroups. We found that mothers’ childcare was reduced by allomothers, but the substitutive effect varied depending on the source and type of care. Playgroups, by playing with children aged 2 and above, consistently predicted a decrease in maternal childcare. While few grandmothers were available, they were nonetheless negatively associated with maternal presence, and thus childcare, as they performed childcare activities, similar to mothers. These results underscore the importance of allomothering in reducing mothers’ childcare workload in the Agta. Mother’s flexibility in obtaining childcare from a range of available sources, including playgroups, may be the key to humans’ life history evolution, underling the necessity of a broad conceptualisation of social support in human childcare.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/1playgroups/","tags":["Social support","Maternal-child health","Cooperative childrearing","Infant feeding","Life history theory","Breastfeeding"],"title":"Page, A.

However, the dominant conceptualizations of support have been heavily influenced by Western family norms. The consequence, at best, has been to stifle our understanding of the nature and consequences of support for mothers and children. At worst, it has led to systematic discrimination negatively impacting maternal–child health. To fully engage with the complexities of social support, we must take multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary approaches spanning diverse cultural and geographical perspectives. However, multidisciplinary knowledge-processing can be challenging, and it is often unclear howdifferent studies from different disciplines relate. To address this, we outline two epistemological frameworks—the scientific approach and Tinbergen’s four questions—that can be useful tools in connecting research across disciplines. In this theme issue on ‘Multidisciplinary perspectives on social support and maternal–child health’, we attempt to foster multidisciplinary thinking by presenting work from a diverse range of disciplines, populations and cultures. Our hope is that these tools, along with papers in this issue, help to build a holistic understanding of social support and its consequences for mothers and their children. Overall, a multidisciplinary perspective points to how the responsibility of childrearing should not fall solely onto mothers. Indeed, this multidisciplinary issue demonstrates that successful childrearing is consistently an activity shared beyond the mother and the nuclear family: an insight that is crucial to harnessing the potential of social support to improve maternal–child health.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/2editoral/","tags":["Social support","Maternal-child health","Cooperative childrearing","Evolutionary ecology","Multidisciplinary"],"title":"Emmott, E.

However, social support encompasses a myriad of different supportive acts, providing scope for diverse infant feeding outcomes. Given the vulnerability of postpartum mental health, this paper aims to explore both how support prolongs breastfeeding and which forms of support promote the positive experience of all infant feeding. Using survey data collected online from 515 UK mothers with infants aged 0–108 weeks, Cox regression models assessed the relationship between receiving different types of support, support need and breastfeeding duration. Quasi-binomial logistic regression models assessed the relationship between receiving support, infant feeding mode and maternal experience of infant feeding. Rates of negative infant feeding experience indicate the widespread need for support: e.g. 38% of currently, 47% of no longer and 31% of never breastfeeding women found infant feeding stressful. Overall, practical support via infant feeding broadly predicted shorter breastfeeding durations and poorer feeding experience; results in relation to other forms of support were more complex. Our findings indicate different forms of support have different associations with infant feeding experience. They also highlight the wide range of individuals beyond the nuclear family on which postpartum mothers in the UK rely.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/4infantfeeding/","tags":["Social support","Maternal-child health","Cooperative childrearing","Evolutionary ecology","Multidisiplinary"],"title":"Myers, S., Page, A.

OSF Pre-print: https://osf.io/byf5g/.\nAbstract\nObjectives: Physical breastfeeding problems can lead women to terminate breastfeeding earlier than planned. In high-income countries, breastfeeding problems have been attributed to the cultural and individual “inexperience” of breastfeeding, ultimately leading to lower breastfeeding rates. Yet, cross-cultural evidence suggests breastfeeding problems still occur in contexts where breastfeeding is common, prolonged and seen publicly. This suggests breastfeeding problems are not unusual and do not necessarily lead to breastfeeding cessation. Having evolved a cooperative childrearing system, what matters for breastfeeding continuation may be the availability of social support during the postnatal period. Here, we test the hypothesis that social support buffers mothers from the negative impact breastfeeding problems have on duration. Methods: We run cox models on a sample of 566 UK mothers who completed a retrospective online survey about infant feeding and social support in 2017-2018. Results: Breastfeeding problems were important predictors of cessation; however, the direction of the effect was dependent on the type of problem. These relationships were also moderated by informational, practical and emotional support from a range of supporters. Helpful support for discomfort issues (blocked ducts, too much milk) significantly reduced the hazard of cessation, as predicted. However, helpful support for reported milk insufficiency increased the hazard of cessation. Conclusions: Experiencing breastfeeding problems is the norm, but its impact may be mitigated via social support. Working from an interdisciplinary approach, our results highlight that a wide range of supporters who provide different types of support have potential to influence maternal breastfeeding experience.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/27bfprob/","tags":["UK","Breastfeeding problems","Infant feeding","Cooperative childrearing","Social support"],"title":"Page, A.

Environmental perception has been linked with both reproduction and parenting, but links between subjective environmental experiences and breastfeeding remain unclear. Using retrospective data from an online survey of UK mothers of children aged 0–24 months, Cox-Aalen survival models test whether negative subjective environmental experiences negatively correlated with any and exclusive breastfeeding (max n = 473). Matching predictions, hazards of stopping any breastfeeding were increased, albeit non-significantly, across the five environmental measures (HR: 1.05–1.26) Hazards for stopping exclusive breastfeeding were however (non-significantly) reduced (HR: 0.65–0.87). Score processes found no significant time-varying effects. However, estimated cumulative coefficient graphs showed that the first few weeks postpartum were most susceptible to environmental influences and that contrary to our predictions, mothers with worse subjective environmental experiences were less likely to stop breastfeeding at this time. In addition, the hazard of stopping exclusive breastfeeding declined over time for mothers who thought that littering was a problem. The predicted increased hazards of stopping breastfeeding were only evident in the later stages of any breastfeeding and only for mothers who reported littering as a problem or that people tended not to know each other. Perceived harsher physical and social environmental conditions are assumed to deter women from breastfeeding, but this may not always be the case. Women’s hazards of stopping breastfeeding change over time and there may be particular timepoints in their breastfeeding journeys where subjective environmental experiences play a role.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/6bfenviro/","tags":["UK","Breastfeeding","Subjective experience","Environment exprience","Crime","Littering"],"title":"Brown, L.

We share their concerns around the underacknowledged costs of breastfeeding, and the need for a truly family-centred approach to breastfeeding support. However, they are mistaken to assume we do not view breastfeeding problems as an important cost of breastfeeding: We explicitly comment on breastfeeding challenges within our paper, and such challenges are theoretically incorporated into the “costs of breastfeeding” following an evolutionary anthropological framework. They are also incorrect in their statement that we recommend breastfeeding promotion messages to wider family members. In fact, we outline in our manuscript that breastfeeding promotional messages can have negative consequences for mothers, and are unlikely to be supportive. What we do suggest is a family-centred approach that recognises that women interact with, and may be supported by, a wide range of individuals (including fathers and grandmothers); and the importance of taking a nuanced approach to support without assuming that all types of support necessarily leads to “more breastfeeding.” We hope our response is useful in clarifying the key points of our paper.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/8typoreply/","tags":["Infant feeding","Breastfeeding","Social support","Maternal Experience","Public Health","UK"],"title":"Emmott, E.

Building on this evidence-base, public health services and interventions aiming to improve breastfeeding rates have primarily targeted informational and emotional support to mothers, reflecting an individual behaviour-change approach. However, mothers exist within a wider social network, and the characteristics of their broader support networks may be an important predictor of breastfeeding outcomes. Here we explore the typologies of postnatal support for mothers in the UK; a population with one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe. Using retrospective data from an online survey (data collection period December 2017 - February 2018), we carry out a latent class regression (n = 432) to identify “clusters” of postnatal support in our data. Mothers in our sample were most likely to report receiving practical and emotional support from partners and maternal grandmothers, and breastfeeding information from health professionals. We identify three distinct typologies of postnatal support:\n Extensive support, where mothers received support from a wide range of supporters including partners, maternal grandmothers, friends and health professionals, but mothers were the only ones to feed the infant; Family support, where mothers received support from partners and maternal grandmothers, including with infant feeding, but less likely to receive support from health professionals; Low support, where mothers primarily received support from partners. 94% of women with extensive support were predicted to be breastfeeding at two months, followed by 48% of mothers in the low support group, and 13% in the family support group. Our findings highlight the complexities of family support and its potential impact on breastfeeding, as well as the significance of professional support.  Overall, our results hint at the potential value for health professionals to engage with wider family in order to achieve extensive support for mothers.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/9typo/","tags":["Infant feeding","Breastfeeding","Social support","Maternal Experience","Public Health","UK"],"title":"Emmott, E.

To test these hypotheses, we used high-resolution proximity data from 1,701 child–alloparent dyads. Our results indicated that reciprocity and relatedness were positively associated with the number of interactions with a child (our proxy for childcare). Need appeared more influential in close kin, suggesting indirect benefits, while reciprocity proved to be a stronger influence in non-kin, pointing to direct benefits. However, despite shared genes, close and distant kin interactions were also contingent on reciprocity. Compared with other apes, humans are unique in rapidly producing energetically demanding offspring. Our results suggest that the support that mothers require is met through support based on kinship and reciprocity.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/10testhypo/","tags":["Alloparenting","Cooperative childrearing","Agta","Hunter-gatherers"],"title":"Page, A.

Most of us may think about a parent or parents, but many of us would also recognize the important role of other people. Perhaps it’s a teacher, a grandparent, or a neighborhood friend. The fact that we are supported by many people in our childhood is, in fact, very unusual: In nonhuman mammals, support – or investments – for juveniles are typically and solely provided by the biological mother. Only 9–10% of mammals display parental care, where biological fathers are additionally involved in raising offspring, without the support of other helpers (Kleiman and Malcolm 1981). In humans, we see a notably different system of facultative fathering, where biological fathers may or may not provide investments into their children, combined with a range of additional caregivers beyond the biological parents. These additional caregivers, or alloparents, can include siblings, grandparents, and extended kin, as well as nonrelatives such as stepparents, friends, and neighbors.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/11alloparent/","tags":["Alloparenting","Cooperative childrearing"],"title":"Emily, E. and Page, A.

However, tests of this hypothesis are obscured by comparing between populations that vary in ecology and social organization, as well as subsistence. Here we test this hypothesis by examining adult time allocation among the Agta — a population of small-scale hunter-gatherers from the northern Philippines who are increasingly engaged in agriculture and other non-foraging work. We find that individuals in camps engaging more in non-foraging work spend more time involved in out-of-camp work and have substantially less leisure time. This difference is largely driven by changes in the time allocation of women, who spend substantially more time engaged in out-of-camp work in more agricultural camps. Our results support the hypothesis that hunting and gathering allows a significant amount of leisure time, and that this is lost as communities adopt small-scale agriculture.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/13lesiure/","tags":["Transition to agriculture","Lesiure time","Time allocation","Hunter-gatherers","Agta"],"title":"Dyble, M. et al.

The Agta, a foraging population from the Philippines, have a skewed sex ratio of 1.29 (129 males per 100 females) aged 15 years or under. We hypothesised that this skew was not caused by greater female deaths, but due to an adaptive response, where more males were produced at birth in reaction to high male-biased extrinsic mortality. To test this hypothesis we utilise census, childcare and mortality data from 915 Agta. The Agta\u0026rsquo;s sex ratio is significantly male-biased in the \u0026lt;1 (n = 48, 2:1) and 1–5 year (n = 170, 1.39:1) age cohorts; however, we find no evidence of systematic female neglect in patterns of childcare. Furthermore, the sex ratio decreases over cohorts, becoming balanced by the end of the juvenile period, owing to significantly higher male mortality. Taken together, these results are not supportive of female infanticide or neglect, and instead suggest an adaptive mechanism, acting in utero as a response to male-biased juvenile mortality, following Fisherian principles of equalising parental investment.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/12boys/","tags":["Biased sex ratios","Female-biased infanticide/neglect","Hunter-gatherers","Agta","Parental investment","Mortality"],"title":"Page, A.

While reciprocity explains many instances of non-kin cooperation, much remains to be understood. A recent suite of models based upon ‘cooperative assortativity’ suggest that non-kin cooperation can evolve if individuals preferentially assort with certain cooperative phenotypes, such as helping those who help others. Here, we test these assortative hypotheses among the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, using an experimental resource allocation game in which individuals divide resources between themselves and camp-mates. Individuals preferentially shared with less cooperative individuals, arguing against cooperative assortativity as a mechanism sustaining resource transfers in this population. Rather, sharing was often based on the recipient\u0026rsquo;s level of need, in addition to kin-based transfers and reciprocal sharing. Contrary to several recent theoretical accounts, in this real-world setting we find no evidence for cooperative assortativity influencing patterns of cooperation. These results may reflect the demands of living in a foraging ecology characterized by high resource stochasticity, necessitating need-based sharing as a system of long-term reciprocity to mitigate repeated subsistence shortfalls.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/15friend/","tags":["Cooperation","Assortativity","Need-based sharing","Reciprocity","Hunter-gatherers","Agta"],"title":"Smith D., et al.

From a development perspective, key interventions include the sedentarisation of these mobile peoples into camps nearby larger towns with sanitation infrastructure and medical care, as increased access to services is assumed to improve outcomes. However, recent research in the Agta (Philippine foragers from North-east Luzon) has demonstrated that individuals residing in more ‘developed’ communities suffer from increased morbidity and mortality. Here, using quantitative and ethnographic data on health collected between 2002 and 2014, we explore why this trend occurs by examining the relationship between key development initiatives with self-reported illness and the uptake of medical interventions with 415 Agta men, women and children. We demonstrate that health outcomes worsen as sedentarisation progresses, despite some increases in medical access. We argue this is because the development paradigm is not evidence-based, but rather stems from an ideological dislike of mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Compounded by cultural insensitivity and daily discrimination, current interventions are ill-suited to the unique needs of hunter-gatherers, and thus ineffective. Based on our findings we offer future short and long-term policy suggestions which seek to reduce the Agta\u0026rsquo;s vulnerability, rather than increase it.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/14health/","tags":["Philippines","Development","Sedentarisation","Hunter-gatherers","Agta","Policy"],"title":"Page, A.

From gathering around the camp-fire telling tales of ancestors to watching the latest television box-set, humans are inveterate producers and consumers of stories. Despite its ubiquity, little attention has been given to understanding the function and evolution of storytelling. Here we explore the impact of storytelling on hunter-gatherer cooperative behaviour and the individual-level fitness benefits to being a skilled storyteller. Stories told by the Agta, a Filipino hunter-gatherer population, convey messages relevant to coordinating behaviour in a foraging ecology, such as cooperation, sex equality and egalitarianism. These themes are present in narratives from other foraging societies. We also show that the presence of good storytellers is associated with increased cooperation. In return, skilled storytellers are preferred social partners and have greater reproductive success, providing a pathway by which group-beneficial behaviours, such as storytelling, can evolve via individual-level selection. We conclude that one of the adaptive functions of storytelling among hunter gatherers may be to organise cooperation.\nVideo\n  ","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/16story/","tags":["Storytelling","Cooperation","Egalitarianism","Hunter-gatherers","Agta"],"title":"Smith, D., et al.

However, in small-scale societies, such as hunter-gatherer populations, time is often not referred to in calendar years, and accurate age estimation remains a challenge. We address this issue by proposing a Bayesian approach that accounts for age uncertainty inherent to fieldwork data. We developed a Gibbs sampling Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that produces posterior distributions of ages for each individual, based on a ranking order of individuals from youngest to oldest and age ranges for each individual. We first validate our method on 65 Agta foragers from the Philippines with known ages, and show that our method generates age estimations that are superior to previously published regression-based approaches. We then use data on 587 Agta collected during recent fieldwork to demonstrate how multiple partial age ranks coming from multiple camps of hunter-gatherers can be integrated. Finally, we exemplify how the distributions generated by our method can be used to estimate important demographic parameters in small-scale societies: here, age-specific fertility patterns. Our flexible Bayesian approach will be especially useful to improve cross-cultural life history datasets for small-scale societies for which reliable age records are difficult to acquire.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/18age/","tags":["Bayesian","Life history theory","MCMC","Agta","BaYaka","Hunter-gatherers"],"title":"Diekmann, Y., et al.

Here, we present the first exploration in humans of the relationship between reproductive success and different measures of network centrality of 39 Agta and 38 BaYaka mothers. We collected three-meter contact (‘proximity’) networks and reproductive histories to test the prediction that individual centrality is positively associated with reproductive fitness (number of living offspring). Rather than direct social ties influencing reproductive success, mothers with greater indirect centrality (i.e. centrality determined by second and third degree ties) produced significantly more living offspring. However, indirect centrality is also correlated with sickness in the Agta, suggesting a trade-off. In complex social species, the optimisation of individuals’ network position has important ramifications for fitness, potentially due to easy access to different parts of the network, facilitating cooperation and social influence in unpredictable ecologies.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/17hgnetwork/","tags":["Social networks","Cooperation","Reproductive success","Proximity networks","Hunter-gatherers","Agta","BaYaka"],"title":"Page, A.

However, contact network structures in traditional small-scale societies, especially hunter-gatherers, are poorly characterized. We developed a portable wireless sensing technology (motes) to study within-camp proximity networks among Agta and BaYaka hunter-gatherers in fine detail. We show that hunter-gatherer social networks exhibit signs of increased efficiency for potential information exchange. Increased network efficiency is achieved through investment in a few strong links among non-kin ‘friends’ connecting unrelated families. We show that interactions with non-kin appear in childhood, creating opportunities for collaboration and cultural exchange beyond family at early ages. We also show that strong friendships are more important than family ties in predicting levels of shared knowledge among individuals. We hypothesize that efficient transmission of cumulative culture may have shaped human social networks and contributed to our tendency to extend networks beyond kin and form strong non-kin ties.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/19cumcult/","tags":["Hunter-gatherers","Wireless sensing networks","Social networks","Cultural evolution","Agta","BaYaka"],"title":"Migliano, A.B., et al.

It has been argued that hunter-gatherer’s complex social structure has facilitated the evolution of cumulative culture by allowing information exchange among large pools of individuals. However, empirical evidence for the interaction between social structure and cultural transmission is scant. Here we examine the reported co-occurrence of plant uses between individuals in dyads (which we define as their “shared knowledge” of plant uses) in BaYaka Pygmies from Congo. We studied reported uses of 33 plants of 219 individuals from four camps. We show that (1) plant uses by BaYaka fall into three main domains: medicinal, foraging, and social norms/beliefs; (2) most medicinal plants have known bioactive properties, and some are positively associated with children’s BMI, suggesting that their use is adaptive; (3) knowledge of medicinal plants is mainly shared between spouses and biological and affinal kin; and (4) knowledge of plant uses associated with foraging and social norms is shared more widely among campmates, regardless of relatedness, and is important for camp-wide activities that require cooperation. Our results show the interdependence between social structure and knowledge sharing. We propose that long-term pair bonds, affinal kin recognition, exogamy, and multi-locality create ties between unrelated families, facilitating the transmission of medicinal knowledge and its fitness implications. Additionally, multi-family camps with low inter-relatedness between camp members provide a framework for the exchange of functional information related to cooperative activities beyond the family unit, such as foraging and regulation of social life.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/22knowshare/","tags":["Cultural transmission","Hunter-gatherers","Cumulative culture","BaYaka","Ethnobotanical knowledge"],"title":"Salali, G.D, et al.

Current Biology, 26 (15): 2017-2021.\nAbstract\nLike many other mammalian and primate societies, humans are said to live in multilevel social groups, with individuals situated in a series of hierarchically structured sub-groups. Although this multilevel social organization has been described among contemporary hunter-gatherers, questions remain as to the benefits that individuals derive from living in such groups. Here, we show that food sharing among two populations of contemporary hunter-gatherers—the Palanan Agta (Philippines) and Mbendjele BaYaka (Republic of Congo)—reveals similar multilevel social structures, with individuals situated in households, within sharing clusters of 3–4 households, within the wider residential camps, which vary in size. We suggest that these groupings serve to facilitate inter-sexual provisioning, kin provisioning, and risk reduction reciprocity, three levels of cooperation argued to be fundamental in human societies. Humans have a suite of derived life history characteristics including a long childhood and short inter-birth intervals that make offspring energetically demanding and have moved to a dietary niche that often involves the exploitation of difficult to acquire foods with highly variable return rates. This means that human foragers face both day-to-day and more long-term energetic deficits that conspire to make humans energetically interdependent. We suggest that a multilevel social organization allows individuals access to both the food sharing partners required to buffer themselves against energetic shortfalls and the cooperative partners required for skill-based tasks such as cooperative foraging.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/20multilevel/","tags":["Hunter-gatherers","Multi-level social structure","Food sharing","Agta","BaYaka"],"title":"Dyble, M., et al.

Here we reconcile the conflicting evidence by proposing that the spread of agriculture involved a life history quality–quantity trade-off whereby mothers traded offspring survival for increased fertility, achieving greater reproductive success despite deteriorating health. We test this hypothesis by investigating fertility, mortality, health, and overall reproductive success in Agta hunter-gatherers whose camps exhibit variable levels of sedentarization, mobility, and involvement in agricultural activities. We conducted blood composition tests in 345 Agta and found that viral and helminthic infections as well as child mortality rates were significantly increased with sedentarization. Nonetheless, both age-controlled fertility and overall reproductive success were positively affected by sedentarization and participation in cultivation. Thus, we provide the first empirical evidence, to our knowledge, of an adaptive mechanism in foragers that reconciles the decline in health and child survival with the observed demographic expansion during the Neolithic.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/21tradeoff/","tags":["Sedentarisation","Hunter-gatherers","Life-history trade-offs","Agta","Transition","Reproductive success","Fertility","Mortality"],"title":"Page, A.

Hunter–gatherer societies offer the greatest insight in to human evolution since they represent the majority of our species' evolutionary history. In order to elucidate the evolution of hunter–gatherer polygyny, we study marriage patterns of BaYaka Pygmies. We investigate (i) rates of polygyny among BaYaka hunter–gatherers; (ii) whether polygyny confers a fitness benefit to BaYaka men; (iii) in the absence of wealth inequalities, what are the alternative explanations for polygyny among the BaYaka. To understand the latter, we explore differences in phenotypic quality (height and strength), and social capital (popularity in gift games). We find polygynous men have increased reproductive fitness; and that social capital and popularity but not phenotypic quality might have been important mechanisms by which some male hunter–gatherers sustained polygynous marriages before the onset of agriculture and wealth accumulation.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/publications/26polygyny/","tags":["Polygynous","Social capital","Hunter-gatherers","BaYaka"],"title":"Chaudhary, N. et al.

To date, evolutionary anthropology’s approach to understanding allomothering has largely (but not exclusively) investigated the ultimate explanations of allomothering (i.e. why it evolved) by examining allomother effects on maternal reproductive success (measured by fertility, child health and/or development and child survival). From this perspective, allomothers are assumed to reduce maternal energetic burden, freeing up the mother, allowing her to ‘stack’ offspring. For a holistic understanding of cooperative childrearing, however, ultimate reasons must be complemented with an understanding of how allomothering translates to increased reproductive success. In addition, while a wide range of contemporary and historical cross-cultural studies have highlighted that mothers receive help with childcare from various individuals (allomothers), little exploration has occurred into why we see diversity in allomothers. This project seeks to explore the complexities of childcare in the Agta.\nIn one paper, we focus on the mechanisms behind how allomothering influences maternal and child outcomes. We asked whether allomothernal childcare substitutes maternal childcare, and whether this is influenced by the type of allomother. By exploring these mechanisms we are better able to hypothesise about the mechanisms behind the evolution of cooperative childrearing and gain insights into human life history. We found that allomother caregiving was associated with reduced maternal childcare, but the substitutive effect varied depending on the source and type of care. Children-only playgroups consistently predicted a decrease in maternal childcare. While grandmothers were rarely available, their presence was negatively associated with maternal presence and childcare, and grandmothers performed similar childcare activities to mothers. These results underscore the importance of allomothering in reducing maternal childcare in the Agta. Our findings suggest that flexibility in childcare sources, including children-only playgroups, may have been the key to human life-history evolution.To find out more, check out our publication on Children are important too, and see my LSHTM Expert Opinion blog on social support for mothers which features this research.\nIn another paper, my colleague Sarah Myers and I were really interested in understanding why the Agta in Palanan had so many boys. To be exact, there were 131 boys aged 5 or under, compared to 87 girls, that’s a sex ratio of 1.51 or 151 boys to every 100 girls! The equivalent figure for the England and Wales is 1.05. Gendercide (either via selective abortion, infanticide, or neglect) is the primary explanation for why we see male-biased sex ratios in many parts of the world today. Anthropologists have often proposed this is the reason sex ratios are often male-biased in hunter-gatherer populations. Here, we decided to explore what were the possible mechanisms behind the biased sex ratio by looking at sex-specific mortality trends and parental investment. Using detailed data on childcare, we found that parents showed no difference in their interactions with children based on their gender. The graph of sex ratios across age cohorts also suggested the idea that females were more likely to die was wrong, because sex ratios decreased rather than increased as the age of cohorts increased. When we looked at mortality in the under 16’s we found that males are more likely to die across this juvenile period and while disease-related mortality was equally likely in both sexes, females were less likely to die of non-disease causes than males. We hope to have provided sufficient cause for looking more critically at behavioural-based assumptions regarding male-biased sex ratios in foraging populations and, in the absence of evidence, avoid the further invocation of gendercide. To hear more about this research, read more in Sarah\u0026rsquo;s excellent blog. or see the open access paper in Evolutionary Human Sciences on Why so many Agta boys?.\nTeaming up with Anushé Hassan - who has done some excellent work on sex-biased parental care in Tanzania, as well as forthcoming work on the impact of market integration on allomothering - we are currently exploring diversity in allomothering. We aim to shed light onto the documented diversity of allomothering by exploring how it varies by livelihood diversity in a population of mobile and settled hunter-gatherers, the Agta. Specifically, we test if we can successfully predict who are important allomothers following a risk-based hypothesis, since cooperation has been argued to have evolved to deal with unpredictability resulting in shortfalls and loss. To hear about the preliminary results from this analysis please see our AAPA 2021 talk \nWho provides childcare, and why this varies, is also likely related to demographic structures. It has long been understood that close kin are essential allomothers, in particular grandmothers who have a vested interest in their grandchildren and an (assumed) reduction in their own caring responsibilities. However, while the importance of grandmothers has been well demonstrated in a number of populations, they also appear to be of little importance in others. Understanding the factors which support, or hinder, grandmaternal childcare, such as demographic schedules, is an important next step. Working with Susie Lee  and Rebecca Sear, we are currently exploring how demographic processes (age-specific fertility and mortality trends) impact grandmaternal presence, availability and willing to provide allomaternal care. This research is informed by findings in the Agta that grandmothers were notable in their absence, providing between 0-3% of childcare. Due to high mortality and residential mobility, only 28% of children resided with a grandmother. In the reduced sample of children with grandmothers (n = 34), grandmaternal involvement only increased to 1-5% likely due to reproductive competition. Further, due to early age at first birth and high fertility (TFR 7.7) many grandmothers (95%) also had several competing offspring and grandoffspring. In settled camps in which grandmothers had fewer dependents (1 versus 2 in mobile camps) they provided 152% more childcare, suggesting the importance of generational overlap.\n  ","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/projects/childcare/","tags":["Cooperative childrearing","Allomothering","Hunter-gatherers","Agta","Female-biased infanticide/neglect","Demography","Parental investment"],"title":"Childcare, parental investment, demography and diversity"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Status: Ongoing\nCo-PIs: Emily Emmott (UCL) \u0026amp; Sarah Myers (UCL \u0026amp; MPI).

The UK performs particularly poorly; while 73% of women initiate, only 47.3% are still breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks. Despite this, many women report a desire to breastfeed for longer. With extensive promotion of ‘Breast is Best,’ it is difficult to argue that low rates are driven by a lack of knowledge about the health benefits of breastfeeding. Low levels of social support is increasingly targeted in initiatives to improve breastfeeding outcomes; however, it may well be that the public health messaging itself, and the medicalised discourse around breastfeeding, also requires review. Current messaging focuses on the health benefits to infants, expecting women to breastfeed out of moral duty and stigmatising those who do not. Breastfeeding is a learnt behaviour and problems are common; however, by framing it as “natural” and omitting information about problems, public health messaging leaves women who struggle feeling unprepared, abnormal and isolated. Stigma and the lack of preparation for the challenges, are likely having a negative impact on women’s feeding experience and, ultimately, their breastfeeding success. Previous methodological issues, however, mean we do not fully understand these relationships.\nWhile qualitative studies have collected extensive, rich and crucial data on the lived experience of infant feeding, sample sizes are relatively small limiting generalisations. Quantitative studies have larger samples, yet are often cross-sectional, lacking detailed information on feeding journeys. While a handful of prospective studies (mainly qualitative) are available, the chaotic nature of the early weeks postpartum leads many researchers to create retrospective study designs, interviewing women several weeks or months later, producing reporting biases. This may be particularly problematic for studying feeding practices; women’s experiences shift over time and self-narratives may be rewritten, making the factors influencing feeding decisions difficult to capture retrospectively. Finally, samples are often biased towards more affluent women who have more time and capacity to respond to surveys. Overall, these methodological limitations create challenges in uncovering population-level causal pathways behind low breastfeeding rates. Here we propose to address these limitations by engaging a large number of diverse women from London in their pregnancy and prospectively tracking their infant feeding journeys using an innovative new methodology.\nAIMS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nLarge-scale, quantitative descriptions tracking women’s infant feeding journeys are lacking, and their production requires fresh methodological approaches. This project, focused on mothers from London in the first instance, will develop and pilot a novel data collection method where mothers can document their own infant feeding journeys through a user-friendly app. Complimented by user experience data to inform future app updates, we will lay the foundations for reliably unpicking the relationships between infant feeding expectations, experience and decisions over time among potentially unlimited numbers of women in the future. Overall, this project has three interwoven aims:\nAIM ONE: Develop an innovative, user-friendly app which engages a larger, more representative sample of women to report real-time experiences of their feeding journeys\nInspired by epidemiological studies which currently use app-based methodologies, we seek to develop an app to collect daily information on infant feeding, entailing minimal user time and effort. To ensure user engagement, we will design the app to allow the users to track, visualise and summarise their own feeding journeys (including graphical functions and records of problems and experiences to structure interactions with health professionals). This aim will be assessed by the degree of user engagement (how many initial downloads, how many users report experiences daily) as well as how socio-demographically diverse our sample is.\nAIM TWO: Pilot and gain feedback on the app before large-scale data collection\nThis project will enable initial piloting of the app, which will form the basis of a later UK-wide roll-out, and large-scale data collection. Collecting user-feedback via survey and focus groups, will enable us to address any issues and increase usability before a large-scale launch – which will lead to lower attrition, better data quality and improved user experience.\nTo meet this aim we will address three research questions: 1A) Did women find it easy and quick to use the app; 1B) What else would they find useful within the app; 1C) How did women engage with the app on a daily basis? These questions will form the basis of a methodological paper about participant-led, app-based data collection in the social sciences.\nAIM THREE: To examine changing expectations and experiences through the infant feeding journeys of pilot participants\nDue to aforementioned methodological issues, the causal relationships between ideology, expectation, experience and breastfeeding continuation remain unknown. Our prospective study design means we can explore how women move between feeding modes, as well the experiences of those who do not initiate breastfeeding.\nTo meet this aim we will conduct a preliminary exploration of the app data framed around three research questions: 2A) How does mode of feeding and women’s feelings about infant feeding change overtime; 2B) how do prior expectations influence feeding experiences and; 2C) how well do women’s breastfeeding experiences predict their likelihood of (exclusive and any) breastfeeding to six weeks, moderated by social support and expectation? These questions will be discussed in a theoretical paper on infant feeding expectations and experiences, and the consequences of this in breastfeeding duration.\nSUMMARY\nPrevious research has not documented the changing and temporal nature of women’s infant feeding experiences on a large-scale. Many women find infant feeding challenging and stressful, perhaps due to medical and social discourse around breastfeeding. However, methodological limitations constrain understandings of the causal pathways underlying maternal feeding decisions. This project will directly contribute to debates surrounding infant feeding by developing and piloting an innovative app for prospectively documenting infant feeding journeys in a large-scale and quantitative fashion.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/projects/bfapp/","tags":["Social support","Maternal mental health","Maternal experience","App development","Infant feeding","Breastfeeding","UK","Cooperative childrearing"],"title":"Infant feeding ideology, expectation and reality"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Status: Ongoing\nCo-PI: Rebecca Sear (LSHTM).\nCollaborators: Colette Berbesque, Jeremy Koster, Monique Borgerhoff Mulder, Heidi Colleran, Karen Kramer, Siohban Mattison, Brooke Scelza, Mary Shenk, Jonathan Stieglitz, John Ziker, Cody Ross, Katie Starkweather, Luis Pacheco-Cobos, Ryan Schacht, Sheina Lew-Levy, Adam Boyette, Shane Macfarlan, Christina Moya, Jennifer French\n​\nBACKGROUND\nThere has long been academic interest in the relationship between fertility and mode of subsistence, spanning anthropology, demography and archaeology. From a prehistoric perspective, archaeologists have pointed to significant population expansions, often referred to as the Neolithic Demographic Transition, due to significant increases in fertility associated, and arguably caused by, the onset of agriculture 12,000-6,000 BP (Diamond, 2002; Diamond and Bellwood, 2003; Bocquet-Appel, 2008; Guerrero, Naji and Bocquet‐Appel, 2008). Demographers have sought to better understand ‘natural’ human fertility prior to the secular decline in fertility in ‘controlled’ population (Campbell and Wood, 1988), while anthropologists, and in particular, human behavioural ecologists, have long explored the relationship between the environment and reproductive strategies, such optimal fertility in mobile foraging communities (Blurton Jones and Sibly, 1978).\nAcross these different disciplines, fertility has been hypothesised to increase with the domestication of plants and livestock, and thus, hunter-gatherers are expected to have lower fertility compared to horticulturalists, pastoralists and agriculturalists (Roth, 1981; Hitchcock, 1982; Roth and Ray, 1985; Hewlett, 1991; Bentley, Goldberg and Jasieńska, 1993; Sellen and Mace, 1997; Kelly, 2013). From the archaeological record, average population growth rates are documented to have risen from \u0026lt;0.001% per year to 0.04% during the early Neolithic (Bandy, 2005; Bellwood and Oxenham, 2008; Cohen and Crane-Kramer, 2007; Downey et al., 2014; Hershkovitz and Gopher, 2008; Wells and Stock, 2007; Willis and Oxenham, 2013; Zahid et al., 2015). There are several possible mechanisms for such population increases associated with changes in diet and activity patterns that accompany agriculture. First, more sedentary and food producing women are argued to experience increased energy availability allowing them to re-invest this into fertility (Ellison, 2003; Starling and Stock, 2007; Bocquet-Appel, 2008). Second, domesticated grains represent a concentrated source of carbohydrates, which increases the available calories and reproductive value (Hausman and Wilmsen, 1985; Herrera, 2000; Hardy et al., 2015). Third, agricultural produce is often used as supplementary foods to speed up weaning and shorten interbirth intervals (Sellen, 2006). While current evidence suggests that the first farmers were no more productive than foragers (Bowles, 2011), and that in contemporary foragers increased agricultural dependence is not necessarily associated with productivity (Dyble et al., 2019), changes in female work patterns between modes of subsistence might have energetic consequences which impact their fecundability (the likelihood of conception in an given month of exposure (Campbell and Wood, 1988)). For instance, increased time in food processing and a reduction of foraging activities, reduces aerobic exercise (rather than productivity) (Kelly, 2013), suggesting that women’s energetics may play an important role in the demographic correlates of subsistence systems.\nHowever, there are a number of studies from current populations which do not support the hypothesis that populations with higher involvement in food production have higher fertility. Campbell and Wood (1988), Hewlett (1991) and Bentley and colleagues (1993) all compared the average TFR of different subsistence types (hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists and agriculturalists), finding little difference between the groups. Focusing on (Hewlett, 1991) results, which are presented in Figure 1, it is apparent that there is wide variability in TFR in the entire sample, ranging from 2.4 – 8.4, mean 5.6 (SD = 1.4) which does not vary significantly between population types: the hunter-gatherer mean TFR was 5.5 (SD = 1.2), pastoralist TFR= 6.1 (SD = 0.8) and the horticultural mean TFR was 6.1 (SD = 1.3). As a consequence, it is not possible to argue that farmers or pastoralists have higher fertility than foragers, in keeping with Campbell and Wood’s (1988) results, which indicated that “hunter-gatherer populations [TFR] appear to be just as variable as tribal populations, which appear to be just as variable as peasant populations” (P. 56).\nFigure 1: Table of TFR reported in Hewlett 1991\nLater studies conducted by Bentley, Jasienska and Goldberg (1993) and Sellen and Mace (1997) ran similar analyses removing transitioning populations from the analysis, reducing the sample size. While Bentley, Jasienska and Goldberg (1993) found that the TFR of agriculturalists was significantly higher than non-agriculturalists, they did not find a significant difference between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists. Bentley and colleagues conclude they cannot use this data to make predictions about fertility levels based on subsistence alone. Finally, Sellen and Mace (1997) used continuous estimates of dependence on difference forms of subsistence, finding that a 10% increase in agriculture was associated with a 0.2 increase in live births. However, this relationship was only apparent in mobile populations, not permanently settled groups. Overall, while the results indicate that foragers mean TFR tends to be lower than other subsistence types, results are mixed, contentious and rarely reach statistical significance given issues of sample variability and statistical power.\nProblematically, such mixed results leave no clear conclusions about the relationship between subsistence type and fertility, and as a review of the literature indicates, this topic is no longer actively explored despite various sources reporting that hunter-gatherers have lower fertility that other populations (Kelly, 2013). Furthermore, there are a number of issues with the previous studies which may produce these mixed results, which can be developed and improved upon in future analyses. These issues can be reduced down to i) a lack of statistical power when comparing means; ii) variability within subsistence types; iii) a lack of boundaries between subsistence types; and iv) data quality issues; These will now be briefly discussed in turn.\nIssue i: Variability and lack of statistical power\nIn Bentley and colleagues’ sample, while the mean TFR is 5.6 for hunter-gatherers and 6.6 for agriculturalists, the standard deviation (SD, σ) of TFR was 1.39. A high SD indicates the mean (or median) does not accurately represent the wider range of values. Given this SD and a sample size of 5-11 hunter-gatherers, this analysis does not have the power to detect a 1.1 change in TFR the majority of the time, even if it was there. Therefore, previous analysis based on categorical subsistence divisions null results may be due to a Type II error given the high variability in TFR between populations within the subsistence category, as highlighted in Table 1.\nIssue ii: Variability within subsistence types\nIssue 1 highlights variability in TFR within the subsistence types, however the categories themselves include variability on more measures than just ‘mode of subsistence’. Modes of subsistence are associated with changes in social and political organisation, degrees of sedentarisation, food storage, wealth accumulation, inequality and varying levels of contact with other populations (Hayden, 1995; Price and Gebauer, 1995; Piperno and Pearsall, 1998; Cohen and Crane-Kramer, 2007; Kelly, 2013). However, these are not uniformly expressed in all populations within a subsistence category. For instance, some hunter-gatherers have hierarchical social and political systems, are largely immobile and as a result have significant wealth and food storage (Woodburn, 1982). Each of these traits may be independently associated with fertility, and the ‘lumping’ of them into one category hides these relationships. How contact with other populations may impact fertility rates is apparent in the some of the lowest and highest TFRs reported in hunter-gatherers: The Efe (Democratic Republic of the Congo) had a reported TFR in 1987 of only 2.6 (Bailey and Aunger, 1995). Researchers have highlighted the high rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) across Africa, resulting in pathologically low levels of fertility (Pennington and Harpending, 1991; Pennington, 2001). The Efe have a primary sterility rate of 28% (Bailey and Aunger, 1995), producing a significantly lower TFR compared to neighbouring Pygmy populations (Aka = 5.5, Mbuti = 5). At the other end of the scale, the Agta have documented TFRs between 6.3 to 7.7 (mean= 6.93) over the last 60 years. While engaging in foraging, the Agta have also historically traded foraged resources for tubers and rice with nearby farmers (Peterson, 1978). Domesticated grains represent a concentrated source of carbohydrates, which improves nutritional condition and thus reproductive potential (Herrera, 2000). These causal relationships have yet to be tested, however, it makes the point that population variability matters.\nIssue iii: A lack of clear boundaries between subsistence types\nSubsistence types are not bounded, innate entities that can be used as an explanatory variable (Kelly, 2013). They are open to interpretation and often influenced by individuals’ ideological stand points (Panter-Brick, Layton and Rowley-Conwy, 2001). Taking the example of hunter-gatherers, it seems at first this is a simple economic category describing groups who lack the domestication of plants or animals. However, there is extreme variability in these subsistence activities; from Cheyenne Native Americans who hunted 80% of their food, to the Inuit who fished (primarily seals) all but 5% of their diet, or the Hadza or Ju/’hoansi who gathered 65-85% of their food (Kelly, 2013). Furthermore, since the earliest ethnographies most hunter-gatherers have derived some of their diet from non-foraged sources. Thus, strict adherence to the ‘absence of domestication’ definition of hunter-gatherers would eliminate most known populations (Washburn and Lancaster, 1968). Rather, how hunter-gatherers have been defined throughout the 19th and 20th centuries is often based on ideology or modelled on a few of the best studied groups (Panter-Brick, Layton and Rowley-Conwy, 2001). Hunter-gatherers were originally defined as male-dominated patrilocal bands (Service, 1962), later an emphasis was placed on mobility and egalitarianism as hunter-gatherers became the ‘original affluent societies’ (Sahlins, 1968). More recently, they were defined by their marginalised role within globalised world-systems (Headland and Reid, 1989). This is important because it highlights the flexibility in definitions, and that hunter-gatherers, like other foraging populations are not discrete entities, suggesting why there is so much overlap in TFR between subsistence groups.\nIssue iv: data quality issues\nWhile the first issues dealt with variability within and between modes of subsistence, this last one considers the methodological issues in demographic data collection. As documented by Hewlett (1991), data sources vary in terms of the reliability of demographic trends. In populations without written demographic records, fieldworkers rely on self-reported genealogies. However, self-reports do not necessarily produce a fully accurate demographic record; recall bias is common, leading to an underreporting of births, miscarriages, stillbirths and infant mortality due to either forgetfulness, a lack of cultural recognition of a ‘birth’ or simple miscommunication (Cronk, 1991; Page et al., 2019). While some researchers go to great lengths to ensure the reliability of self-reports with increase probing, cross-references and longitudinal data collection (Hill and Hurtado, 1996; Early and Headland, 1998; Howell, 2010; Marlowe, 2010; Headland, Headland and Uehara, 2011), other sources, particularly older ethnographic reports are questionable sources of demographic data (Hewlett, 1991). Additional issues include small sample sizes from non-industrial populations how are especially vulnerable to stochastic (random) demographic variation. In terms of long-term growth or decline, in a large population, individual events are ‘averaged’ out, while in smaller groups this random variation has disproportionate influence; patterns of growth and decline are far more extreme and volatile in small populations (Richter-Dyn and Goel, 1972; Mace et al., 2008). Consequently, in a small population an extremely low or high fertility rate may be the outcome of the size of the sample. Finally, cross-cultural studies use subsistence and fertility data from different time points, or average across different populations of the same ethnolinguistic group (Sellen and Mace, 1997). Given the wide variable in TFR reported in Agta populations (as well as large differences in mortality, livelihoods, behaviour and socioeconomic position, see (Page et al., 2016, 2019)) across a relatively small geographic distance, for instance, such practices may be hiding within population trends.\nSo, where do we take this literature from here? What can be done to improve the quality of the analysis?\nProposed methodology\nThis proposal attempts to overcome these previous difficulties by looking at the relationship between subsistence and fertility at the individual level in a wide range of subsistence-level populations, expanding on the methodology applied in Page et al., (2016). This method correlates individual involvement in different forms of subsistence (as a proportion of total activities, i.e. 75% hunting and gathering vs. 25% of time in cultivation) and degree of mobility (residential camp movements) with (age-controlled) fertility. As a result, there is no need to place populations into somewhat arbitrary subsistence groups for analysis, make assumptions about how ‘traditional’ or not they are or use mean values which disregard the intra-population variability. This analysis demonstrated that within this one population (the Agta), cultivation and sedentism was positively correlated with age-specific fertility ratees (Page et al., 2016). However, this is only one population of hunter-gatherers in a very specific socio-ecological context with a small sample (n = 117). To further this research question, a similar methodology should be applied in a wide range of populations. This method accounts for the following:\n  Within populations there are wide variations in fertility. Just as the mean TFR on a mode of subsistence may be unreflective of the distribution, the same is true of intra-population variation.\n  Individuals within a population demonstrate varying engagement with foraging (hunting, gathering and fishing), cultivation/horticulture and pastoralism. These differences are also likely related to differences in mobility and settlement. This method allows an exploration of the relationship between degree of engagement in different activities and fertility, as well as pulling apart the relationship of settlement from subsistence.\n  ","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/projects/fert/","tags":["Fertility","Subsistence","Hunter-gatherers","Agriculture","Neolithic demographic transition","Cross-cultural"],"title":"Fertility and subsistence - a cross-cultural analysis"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Status: Wrapping up\nCo-PIs: Emily Emmott (UCL) \u0026amp; Sarah Myers (UCL \u0026amp; MPI)\nFunding: European Human Behaviour and Evolution Society\nWhile the public health literature demonstrates a positive association between social support and breastfeeding, research has generally focused on informational and emotional support, overlooking practical help. Research also overlook wider sources of support, such as grandparents. Informed by evolutionary theory, we investigate how different types of support from different allomothers are associated with breastfeeding duration and maternal experience of infant feeding.\nIn the winter of 2017-2018 over 700 women from the UK took part in an online survey asking about their experiences infant feeding, problems they faced and support they received. As we were particularly interested in a wide range of supporters and the effect of different types of support we asked questions on emotional support, informational support and broke practical support down to infant feeding support, housework, childcare, and financial and material support. We also asked questions about the women\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience of their local environment to understand how physical social environmental factors impacted breastfeeding.\nOur findings have demonstrated that mothers with infants are helped by a wide range of supporters, from family, friends and health care professionals. However, some women are supported more by family, and less by health care professionals, while some women receive less support across all potential supporters. Who supports mothers has implications for breastfeeding duration as mothers who breastfed for more than two months were most likely to report extensive support from family, friends and health care professionals. To find out more check out our publication on Typologies of postnatal support.\nFurther analyses demonstrated that the type of support mattered. Not all support is equal, and not all support will necessarily increased breastfeeding duration as assumed. We found infant feeding support (i.e. when someone else feeds your infant) predicted shorter breastfeeding durations and poorer feeding experience. The direction of causality is, of course, unknown - and the focus of future data collection - but it highlights that it is important to think about the mechanisms of support. To find out more check out our publication on The differential role of practical and emotional support.\nIn an analysis looking at the maternal perception of the environment we found the relationship between subjective experience and breastfeeding was a complex one. Estimated cumulative coefficient graphs showed that the first few weeks postpartum were most susceptible to environmental influences and that contrary to our predictions, mothers with worse subjective environmental experiences were less likely to stop breastfeeding at this time. In addition, the hazard of stopping exclusive breastfeeding declined over time for mothers who thought that littering was a problem. The predicted increased hazards of stopping breastfeeding were only evident in the later stages of any breastfeeding and only for mothers who reported littering as a problem or that people tended not to know each other. Perceived harsher physical and social environmental conditions are assumed to deter women from breastfeeding, but this may not always be the case. To find out more check out our paper on\tSubjective Environmental Experiences and Women’s Breastfeeding Journeys.\nIn a OSF pre-print we also explore the role of social support in buffering the supposed negative effects of breastfeeding problems on breastfeeding duration. The interest in exploring this question arose from the observation that breastfeeding problems are very common (in fact around 94% of our sample reported at least one problem, and almost 50% suffered 2 or 3 problems), and women often report breastfeeding problems - such as pain, insufficient milk or latch issues - as reasons to stop breastfeeding, some women are able to overcome and deal with these problems to continue breastfeeding while others are not. We were interested in understanding if it was variability in experience in social support which predicted the relationship between problem and duration. We found that breastfeeding problems were important predictors of cessation but the direction of the effect was dependent on the type of problem, and dependent on if support was received. Support for discomfort issues (blocked ducts, too much milk) significantly reduced the hazard of cessation, as predicted. However, helpful support for reported milk insufficiency increased the hazard of cessation. To find out more check out our OSF pre-print on\tTesting the buffering hypothesis: breastfeeding problems, cessation and social support in the UK.\nWhile this project is now coming to a close, a Masters student in Reproductive and Sexual Health Research at the LSHTM is currently conducting a mixed-methods study focusing specifically on health visitors, maternal experience of breastfeeding and duration. In particular, Annika Chambers is interested in the relationship between emotional and informational support, and the degree the effectiveness of informational support is dependent on the receipt of emotional support.\n","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/projects/bfsupport/","tags":["Social support","Maternal experience","Infant feeding","Breastfeeding","UK","Cooperative childrearing"],"title":"Social support, maternal experience and infant feeding"},{"categories":["R"],"contents":"  R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

Working as a team of 6 PhD students (3 in the Philippines and 3 in the Congo) we collected a mountain of data on all spheres of life. This produced a large number of articles on cooperation, marriage systems, social organisation, aging, social networks and cumulative culture which can be found in my publications page.\nMy particular focus was on cooperative childrearing, and as part of my PhD alongside Sylvain Viguier, we collected over 700 hours of observations of Agta children. We closely observed all the children we could, their behaviour, who cared for them or supervised them, who they played with and where they were in and about camp. This amazing dataset has formed the basis of a number of research papers on parental investment, cooperative childcare and maternal workload, as well as more to come in the future.\nSylvain Viguier\u0026rsquo;s role in the project was to develop remote sensing devices to capture proximity social networks without infrastructure (given the remote locations where the Agta lived). These are called motes, which send beacons to one another at regular intervals to monitor who is in spatial proximity to who. We asked all camp members, men, women and children, to wear these motes for around a week to capture in-depth, but quick, snapshots into their social worlds as measured by proximity. The development of this methodology was a lot of fun, as well as being rather challenging at times, and it formed the basis on a number of papers on the Agta\u0026rsquo;s social networks, including my own on reproductive success and health, and other\u0026rsquo;s work on cumulative culture and multilevel social structure. To hear more about the motes, and these research projects see this short video.\nFinally, thanks to additional funding from the UCL Graduate Fund and the Beacon Bursaries Public Engagement fund I was able to collect unique detailed data on the Agta\u0026rsquo;s health and wellbeing, and share this information with the Agta in an interactive workshop at the end of data collection. Working with local health care professionals, I conducted point-of-care red and white blood cells tests, recent medical histories, blood pressure, stool samples, TB tests and anthropometrics. Using this data I explored the relationship between livelihood change, health and demographics. The Agta are a diverse population who live in both mobile and settled camps, engaging in different amounts of fishing, foraging, wage labour and farming. I was particularly interested in finding out if, as predicted by epidemiological transition models, settled camps suffered from worse outcomes than mobile groups. In work published in PNAS, we found evidence of increased viral and helminthic infections in settled, compared to mobile groups, as well as high childhood mortality rates. However, households residing in the most permanent of camps ultimately had more children surviving to age 16 because they had significantly higher fertility, perhaps related to changes in maternal energetics. In an seperate publication, working with Tessa Minter, who has worked with the Agta for many years, we also explored ethnographic data on health and access to health care. We demonstrate that health outcomes worsen as sedentarisation progresses, despite some increases in medical access. We argue this is because the development paradigm is not evidence-based, but rather stems from an ideological dislike of mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyles. In a paper published in Social Science and Medicine we offer future short and long-term policy suggestions which seek to reduce the Agta\u0026rsquo;s vulnerability, rather than increase it.\nMy PhD thesis is now freely available via OSF Thesis Commons.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\n First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on.  Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\n Creating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users)  The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026lsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026lsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","permalink":"https://abbeyepage.com/blog/force-ssl/","tags":["apache","apache","redirect","rewrite","ssl","web development"],"title":"Forcing Visits to use SSL"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JSON\u0026#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026#34;contents\u0026#34;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
